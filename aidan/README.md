A video and some screenshots.

Data are at 3 levels of details as you zoom in/out

Levels:
 - average median across the three scenarios
 - median for each of the three scenarios (red, green, blue for rcp26, rcp45, rcp85)
 - percentile values (5th, 10th, 30th, 33rd, 50th, 67th, 70th, 90th and 95th) for the whole time period, plus the median for the selected
 
Disclaimer: As a visualisation researcher, I would say that the curves aren't effective because they are all too similar. 

Really, just demonstrating interactive zoom-level detail and some opportunities to summarise lots of information about uncertainty and distributions!
